## LEDDER - Motion Triggered Stair Lighting
This was a personal project of mine to make motion triggered stair lights. It uses custom designed PCBs and 3D models, so I wouldn't call it beginner friendly. Feel free to use any of this for your own project.

### Main points of this project
- Very warm, 2000K LEDs ([C5440671](https://lcsc.com/product-detail/LED-Indication-Discrete_XINGLIGHT-XL-3806WWC_C5440671.html?s_z=n_C5440671%2520)) were chosen for cozy feel and to not be harsh on the eyes at night
- Slow fade-in fade-out, dimming is also gamma corrected so it's nicely linear
- Two sensors so it can be triggered when approaching any side of the stairs.
- Motion sensors combined with photoresistors for triggering only when it's dark
- Fuse not only on the control board but also on every step light, each sensor. Safety first.

### Requirements (apart from PCBs, PCB compontents and 3D printing)
- Power supply used is 12V MeanWell LRS-75-12 (the case has screw positions for it)
- 12x M3x5 hot-melt inserts
- 6x M2x5 hot-melt inserts
- 2x M20x1.5 cable gland

### Some notes
- Each light PCB is designed to be broken apart into two half-circle boards
- Two variants of light PCB are added (for 3806 LEDs and for 4008 LEDs), choose 3806 version for the recommended amber LEDs.
- See images to get better idea of how this looks and works
